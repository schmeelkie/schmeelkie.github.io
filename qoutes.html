<h1> Qoutes</h1>
<ul> 
<li>If you're trying to achieve, there will be roadblocks. I've had them; everybody has had them. But obstacles don't have to stop you. If you run into a wall, don't turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it, or work around it.</li>
</br>
<li>I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.</li>
</br>
<li> Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.</li>
</br>
<li> You have to learn the rules of the game. And then you have to play better than anyone else.</li>
</br>
<li>In order to succeed, we must first believe that we can.</li>
