    <p>Steve Jobs will never know how much he impacted the world and specifically my life. My first computer was a Mac back in 1989. I crashed, tinkered with, reinstalled that mac into the wee hours more times than I can count. Little did I know at that time it would influence me so deeply and set me on path to what I am today. I am an IT consultant and am fortunate to have my own business and love what I do. In a nutshell you could say I owe a great deal to him in shaping the person I am today. May you Rest In Peace Steve Jobs. You were one in a million and influenced, impacted and changed the world in more ways than you know. You will truly be missed but never forgotten.</p>
