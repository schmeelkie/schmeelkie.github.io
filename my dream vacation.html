<h2> Why I wanna go to Africa!</h2>
<ul>

<li>South Africa's natural offerings are far more vast than just what is located in Kruger. Consider the following statement: though South Africa has less than 1% of the world's land surface, it has 6% of the world's known mammal and reptile species and 10% of the world's plant, fish, and bird species. </li>
</br>
<li> In general South Africa is a very sunny country, with many areas experiencing over 300 sunny days per year. The Western Cape, where Cape Town is located, has a Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters</li>
</br>
<li> you can go to the zoo to see an elephants or  lions</li>
 
</ul>
